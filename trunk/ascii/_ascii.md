# generatedArt

Generating art anyway anyhow.

## shell
**image2ansi** - [https://github.com/lloiser/img2ansi](https://github.com/lloiser/img2ansi)
This works and generates ansi art that is very terminal friendly. The only caveat is that its all 0.

**ansize** - [https://github.com/jhchen/ansize](https://github.com/jhchen/ansize)
This works. Uses more than just zeros.

**img2txt.py [ANSI]** - [https://github.com/hit9/img2txt](https://github.com/hit9/img2txt)
```bash
$ python img2txt.py mm_crest_180_215.png --ansi --maxLen 50 --targetAspect 0.5
```

## does not work
**ascii_py** [https://github.com/ProfOak/ascii_py/blob/master/ascii_py/main.py](https://github.com/ProfOak/ascii_py/blob/master/ascii_py/main.py)
Generates jpg from jpg. So kinda weird. does work, but idk why you would want it.
