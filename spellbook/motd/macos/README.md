# osx_sys_info
Bash script to pull useful information from a system running OS X 

This repo is essentially a fork of [this earlier project](https://github.com/marshki/bash_sys_info) I scripted, modified to work from a Bash Shell in OS X. 

Work in progress 2016.11.24 

#TODO: 

- [ ] Write independent functions for information to be extracted
- [ ] sys_info.sh function: os info, kernel version, name, & version 
- [ ] `ip` command not found in OS X 
- [ ] `free` command not found in OS X
- [ ] `vmstat` command not found in OS X 
- [ ] `ps auxf` chokes on pipe in OS X  
- [ ] go with verbose command line options when possible
